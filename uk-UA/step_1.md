Web designers carefully consider the font styles for their website. 

The **three** most common categories of font are:

+ Library fonts
+ Web safe fonts
+ Fallback fonts

**Library fonts** are typically imported from a third-party library such as [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Companies sometimes pay a fee to use a font as part of their website branding. 

**Web safe fonts** are standard fonts that should be available through any web browser. However, you can never be 100% sure that this is the case. Here is a list of web safe fonts:

+ Arial 
+ Verdana 
+ Helvetica 
+ Tahoma 
+ Trebuchet MS 
+ Times New Roman 
+ Georgia 
+ Garamond 
+ Courier New 
+ Brush Script MT 

**Fallback fonts** are generic font families that are used to match the styling that the web designer would like to use. The main font families are:

+ Serif: a font style typically used in print publishing, letters have tiny decorative edges called 'serifs'
+ Sans-serif: a clean screen-readable font without the decorative edges
+ Monospace: a font where each character uses the same width of space
+ Cursive: a handwriting font
+ Fantasy: a decorative font typically used for big headings

If a fallback font isn't listed, then the web browser uses the browser's default font, which is typically Times New Roman.
